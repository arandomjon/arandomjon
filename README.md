## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jon (he/him) ðŸ˜„

Impressively, this is my first time publicly posting on GitHub, even though I have had this account for a couple years.
I run an online radio station called WJON IP Radio. Surprisingly, none of the code that I use has made it on here, but that will change.

Hopefully, I am planning on optimizing and creating new coding tools that allow me to post my radio station logs on social media and other sources!
